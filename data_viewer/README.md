# Data Viewer

Data viewer can help us easily make queries on the Yelp Dataset.

## Usage

Make sure `yelp_dataset` folder is in the root directory of this repo and then run `create_database.py` to create a database based on SQLite.

You can also directly download the database [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1v-ayr_m-0MUgviN6pulnRzdn-5hx9oQC) and put it in this directory.

Then we can perform some queries on the yelp dataset.

Refer to `queries.ipynb` for some basic queries examples. More information [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/query.html).
